Notes:

helperspygame.py

    class ResourceLoaderPygame:
        implement new feature to support flipped tiles (newer versions of tiled support that)

    class Sprite: 
        will stay the same (more or less)
    class Layer: 
        will be a public class

    Layer.merge([layers]) -> Layer  
        layers is a list of the layers that should be merged into one layer, not sure yet what this list contains
    Layer.scale(Layer, factor) -> Layer 
        should be pretty straight forward
    Layer.collapse(Layer, level) -> Layer 
        collapses the layer

    class RendererPygame: 
        will probably be removed and replaces with a camera class since 
        there isn't more to it than cam set_camera_position() and render_layer()
        
    class Camera:
        the new mentioned camera class
        

    maybe introduce a global image cache
