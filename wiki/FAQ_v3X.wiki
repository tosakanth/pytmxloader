*Question: (2011-12-16)*
    I get the error: "NameError: global name '__file__' is not defined"

    Why do I get this error?

*Answer:*
    Run the script from within the console or double click it (don't run it from within IDLE or other IDE nor from the interactive command prompt).

*Question: (2011-12-17)*
    Does it work with diamond shaped tiles?

*Answer:*
    Isometric maps can be loaded, but there is currently (version 3.1.x) no renderer (neither for pygame nor pyglet) to render those maps.
